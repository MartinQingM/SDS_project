# SDS project

This is the source code folder for Surgical Data Science course project.

Project title: **Extended validation for a CNN based surgical skill assessment method**

The project is based on the work in:

[Evaluating surgical skills from kinematic data using convolutional neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02750)

All codes can run in Google Colab. 

Start by running [SDS_DATAsetup_analysis.ipynb](./SDS_DATAsetup_analysis.ipynb)

Other validation methods can be run separately in different files.
